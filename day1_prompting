    "# Day 1 - Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Kaggle 5-day Generative AI course!\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will show you how to get started with the Gemini API and walk you through some of the example prompts and techniques that you can also read about in the Prompting whitepaper. You don't need to read the whitepaper to use this notebook, but the papers will give you some theoretical context and background to complement this interactive notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Before you begin\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll start exploring prompts and prompt parameters using the Python SDK and AI Studio. For some inspiration, you might enjoy exploring some apps that have been built using the Gemini family of models. Here are a few that we like, and we think you will too.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [TextFX](https://textfx.withgoogle.com/) is a suite of AI-powered tools for rappers, made in collaboration with Lupe Fiasco,\n",
    "* [SQL Talk](https://sql-talk-r5gdynozbq-uc.a.run.app/) shows how you can talk directly to a database using the Gemini API,\n",
    "* [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) uses Gemini models to build your own personal AI research assistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### A note on the Gemini API and Vertex AI\n",
    "\n",
    "In the whitepapers, most of the example code uses the Enterprise [Vertex AI platform](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai). In contrast, this notebook, along with the others in this series, will use the [Gemini Developer API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/) and [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Both APIs provide access to the Gemini family of models, and the code to interact with the models is very similar. Vertex provides a world-class platform for enterprises, governments and advanced users that need powerful features like data governance, ML ops and deep Google Cloud integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "AI Studio is free to use and only requires a compatible Google account to log in and get started. It is deeply integrated with the Gemini API, which comes with a generous [free tier](https://ai.google.dev/pricing) that you can use to run the code in these exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are already set up with Google Cloud, you can check out the [Enterprise Gemini API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/inference) through Vertex AI, and run the samples directly from the supplied whitepapers."

       "This file is a bash script named `git-prompt.sh`,  designed to enhance your command prompt with Git repository information. Here's a breakdown of its purpose and why you might use it:\n",
       "\n",
       "**What it does:**\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Adds Git Information to Your Prompt:** When you're inside a Git repository, this script modifies your command prompt to display:\n",
       "    * **Current Branch:**  Shows the current branch you're working on.\n",
       "    * **Status Indicators:**  Indicates if the repository has unstaged changes, staged changes, conflicts, untracked files, or stashes.\n",
       "    * **Upstream Tracking:**  Shows your current branch's relationship to its upstream remote branch (if you're tracking one). \n",
       "    * **Username and Repository:**  (Optional) Displays the username and repository name if configured.\n",
       "* **Customizability:**  The script provides a wealth of configuration options to tailor the appearance of the prompt, such as:\n",
       "    * **Colors:** Change the colors of the elements displayed.\n",
       "    * **Symbols:**  Choose symbols to represent different statuses.\n",
       "    * **Prefix and Suffix:**  Add custom text before or after the Git information.\n",
       "    * **Themes:**  Use predefined themes for common color schemes or create your own custom themes. \n",
       "* **Virtual Environment Integration:** The script can also integrate with virtual environments (like Python's `virtualenv` or Node's `nvm`) to display the currently active environment in the prompt.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Why you would use it:**\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Enhanced Awareness:** Makes it immediately clear which Git repository you're working in and its current state. This can save you time and prevent mistakes. \n",
       "* **Simplified Workflow:**  Allows you to quickly glance at the prompt to understand the repository's status without needing to run separate Git commands.\n",
       "* **Customization:**  Provides a powerful and flexible way to customize the information displayed in your prompt, making it visually appealing and informative.\n",
       "\n",
       "**How to Use It:**\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Download:** Obtain the `git-prompt.sh` script. \n",
       "2. **Placement:**  Place the script in a location accessible from your shell environment (e.g., your home directory, a directory in your PATH).\n",
       "3. **Source It:** In your shell's configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`), add the following line:\n",
       "   ```bash\n",
       "   source /path/to/git-prompt.sh\n",
       "   ```\n",
